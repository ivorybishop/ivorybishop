- 👋 Hi, I’m @ivorybishop
- 👀 I’m interested in just about everything, which is costly sometimes and is the way most hobbies hurt your feelings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, javascript, html, css, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate once I learn how to actually do something useful and get some experience under my belt..err, fingertips.
- 📫 How to reach me: just message me here. I keep a browser tab open most days.
